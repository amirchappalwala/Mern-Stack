# MERN Stack Project

Welcome to my **MERN Stack Project**! This project is the culmination of my learning journey through the Net Ninja's comprehensive MERN stack course. By following this, I gained hands-on experience in building full-stack applications using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This repository showcases the skills and concepts I have mastered.

In this project, you'll find a complete MERN stack application that includes:

- A RESTful API built with Node.js and Express
- A MongoDB database for data storage and retrieval
- A dynamic user interface created with React
- Front-end and back-end integration
- User authentication and authorization
- Deployment setup for production
